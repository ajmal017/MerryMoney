                                Getting “early access” to options or Web is defined as signing up with a valid email address for a spot in MerryMoney Financial’s respective waitlist queues for Web or for options. Getting “early access” to MerryMoney Crypto is defined as signing up with a valid email address for a spot in MerryMoney Crypto’s waitlist queue.

                                Margin trading involves interest charges and risks, including the potential to lose more than deposited or the need to deposit additional collateral in a falling market. Before using margin, customers must determine whether this type of trading strategy is right for them given their specific investment objectives, experience, risk tolerance, and financial situation. For more information please see MerryMoney Financial’s Margin Disclosure Statement, Margin Agreement and FINRA Investor Information. These disclosures contain information on MerryMoney Financial’s lending policies, interest charges, and the risks associated with margin accounts. <br /> <br />
                                Investors should consider the investment objectives and unique risk profile of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) carefully before investing. ETFs are subject to risks similar to those of other diversified portfolios. Leveraged and Inverse ETFs may not be suitable for all investors and may increase exposure to volatility through the use of leverage, short sales of securities, derivatives and other complex investment strategies. <br /> <br />
                                Although ETFs are designed to provide investment results that generally correspond to the performance of their respective underlying indices, they may not be able to exactly replicate the performance of the indices because of expenses and other factors. A prospectus contains this and other information about the ETF and should be read carefully before investing. Customers should obtain prospectuses from issuers and/or their third party agents who distribute and make prospectuses available for review. ETFs are required to distribute portfolio gains to shareholders at year end. These gains may be generated by portfolio rebalancing or the need to meet diversification requirements. ETF trading will also generate tax consequences. Additional regulatory guidance on Exchange Traded Products can be found by clicking here. <br /> <br />
                                Options transactions may involve a high degree of risk. Please review the options disclosure document entitled the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options available through <a href="https://www.theocc.com">www.theocc.com</a> to learn more about the risks associated with options trading. <br /> <br />
                                The cash management program is expected to be offered by MerryMoney Financial LLC. The cash management program, when operational, will be an added program to MerryMoney brokerage accounts and will not be a separate account or a bank account. MerryMoney Financial will provide additional information on the cash management program once it is operational to help customers, including those with “early access,” to determine if they want to add the program to their brokerage account. <br /> <br />

                                Cryptocurrency is a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value, but it does not have legal tender status. Cryptocurrencies are sometimes exchanged for U.S. dollars or other currencies around the world, but they are not currently backed nor supported by any government or central bank. Their value is completely derived by market forces of supply and demand, and they are more volatile than traditional currencies. Trading in cryptocurrencies comes with significant risks, including volatile market price swings or flash crashes, market manipulation, and cybersecurity risks. In addition, cryptocurrency markets and exchanges are not regulated with the same controls or customer protections available in equity, option, futures, or foreign exchange investing. Cryptocurrency trading requires knowledge of cryptocurrency markets. In attempting to profit through cryptocurrency trading, you must compete with traders worldwide. You should have appropriate knowledge and experience before engaging in substantial cryptocurrency trading. Cryptocurrency trading may not generally be appropriate, particularly with funds drawn from retirement savings, student loans, mortgages, emergency funds, or funds set aside for other purposes. Cryptocurrency trading can lead to large and immediate financial losses. Under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position quickly at a reasonable price. This can occur, for example, when the market for a particular cryptocurrency suddenly drops, or if trading is halted due to recent news events, unusual trading activity, or changes in the underlying cryptocurrency system. Several federal agencies have also published advisory documents surrounding the risks of virtual currency. For more information see, the <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201408_cfpb_consumer-advisory_virtual-currencies.pdf">CFPB’s Consumer Advisory</a>, the <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/idc/groups/public/@customerprotection/documents/file/customeradvisory_urvct121517.pdf">CFTC’s Customer Advisory</a>, the <a href="https://www.investor.gov/additional-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alert-bitcoin-other-virtual-currency">SEC’s Investor Alert</a>, and <a href="http://www.finra.org/investors/alerts/bitcoin-more-bit-risky">FINRA’s Investor Alert</a>. <br /> <br />
